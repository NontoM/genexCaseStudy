GENEX SURVEY multi-step form


A multi-step form is a long-form that is broken into pieces. The reason for doing this is to make the form easier to complete. Each step represents grouped inputs that are related to each other, so users are not frightened by the length of the form. It might be more comfortable for users to fill the information step by step because their minds should process fewer fields at the time.


The conversion rate is one of the most substantial benefits of a multi-step form. It is believed that multi-step forms have a better conversion rate. Other benefits include the first impression, which is less overwhelming to users, and progress bars, which encourage users to proceed with the form.


UI and UX changes and reason for changes

UI was improved, by reducing spaces and making a form look brief, saving time a user spends feeling data.



(Bootstrap is an open-source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.)

Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world’s most popular front-end component library.
I also made the choice of using bootstrap for the front end base on all the feature listed above, button, color choice  and mobile responsiveness it produces when developing web apps and much more


I also made use of jquery for the progress bar because of the light nature of jquery and I Added 'Previous' buttons These buttons were added to make the user experience easier, the user can have an option to go back to the previous input and edit data should he/she finds the need to do so.
