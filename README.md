UI and UX changes

UI was improved, by reducing spaces and making a form look brief, saving time a user spends feeling data.


Added 'Previous' buttons

These buttons were added to make the user experience easier, the user can have an option to go back to the previous input and edit data should he/she finds the need to do so.
